            <br>Coldplay began when lead vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met during orientation week for their studies at University College London in 1996. Originally called Pectoralz, the band included Guy Berryman on bass and Will Champion on drums. Over the years, the group took on other unique titles like Starfish before eventually becoming Coldplay.
            <br>Throughout a highly illustrious and esteemed career, Coldplay has garnered eight Brit Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and seven Grammy Awards from 25 nominations. The band has sold over 80 million records worldwide because of its dynamic approach to each new album.
            <br>After nearly 25 years together, Coldplay remains a force to be reckoned with. A one-of-a-kind sound, inspirational lyrics, and vibrant live shows effortlessly capture the magic of this revolutionary band. Not to mention, the group’s star-studded collection of top-notch collabs with Beyoncé, Rihanna, Tove Lo, and many others seal the deal on their music legend status. Additional work with well-known music producers like Max Martin and Rik Simpson is also a solid accomplishment.</p>
