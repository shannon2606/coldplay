Coldplay
The band has been well-known for very long now -- even some from the "boomer" generation knows about Coldplay! However, they are well-known for the work they did back then. In this new revamped site, it is meant to cater to the different age groups, enticing them to learn more about the band and their current work as well!

Design Process
XD URL: https://xd.adobe.com/view/f54e66d0-09a6-4057-8cf5-419e67efaeab-a01d/ 
Pinterest Mood Board: https://pin.it/1lQ9Jvg

As a user/fan, I want the site to be very closely tied to the energy and vibe of the band, as well as making the site easily accessible and clear about the information.

As a designer, I want the site to be very focused on the color theme and following it strictly, as well as choose colors that can evoke emotions and maintain the same energy from the band and the website so that fans can feel closer and happier as they visit the site.

As a scriptwriter, I want the site to contain more information, to interest the fans or newcomers to get to know the band more.

Existing Features

birthday (sign up): users get to input their birthday and on the day of their birthday, the band could send them a sms/email of wishes or a little card, or even discount on the merchandises.

arranged the timeline in a neater form and placed at the side of the page so that users have an easier time in finding the timeline of the band's album

embeded a spotify playlist of the band's newest album -- as they allow users to have a short preview of each song -- so that users can listen to the previews and enjoy the music while they browse through the site, possibly making them interested in the album and searching it up to listen to it.

Features Left to Implement
create a search bar in the site for the users to easily search for something 
include a store page in the website as well as a login page 
include some mini games to play on the site (to reduce carbon emissions) --> mobile app has that feature 
include an inbox page announcement page for the users when they login 
make the site more disabled-friendly

Technologies Used:
Javascript, Visual Studio Code, 
Color Hunt: https://colorhunt.co/ --> to help with the color theme
FontAwesome: https://fontawesome.com/icons --> use the icons to link it to the social media pages of the band's

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing

Under Find Us Page, there is a sign up form at the end.
Fill in the details
Press Submit, nothing happens
--> i tried to make an animation of the sign up box changing but I couldn't understand/get it so I removed it to not disrupt the rest of my code

Some pages of my website has an invisible border somewhere. when i coded one of the pages, it worked well so i decided to reuse it for the most of my pages. However, after putting the similar code into other pages, some of them have elements stuck at the bottom of the website. when i tried to shift the elements up, they get cut off at the same height they were at, as if there was like a layer on top of them [(there wasn't. i spent hours--HOURS-- on it and i couldn't figure out the issue ):]
